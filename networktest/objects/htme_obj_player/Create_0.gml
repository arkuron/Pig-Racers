 *
 * SADLY, due to current limitations in GML, we can't access any of this variables by their
 * name in the engine. You need to add their values to a special list in begin step and
 * retrieve them in end step. Go to these events in this demo object and you'll see.
 *
 * Name is synced to update the name (obviously) and is sent SMART and with great delay between the
 * syncs, since it shouldn't actually sync at all. At this point we should note, that all variable
 * groups also get synced automatically when needed, for example if someone connects or changes room.
 *
 * The second group syncs the controls every step, this is the important part, this is what actually
 * moves the player.
 *
 * Since no type was changed, the default type FAST is chosen, this means packets get sent
 * only once, but very fast.
 * This however means, that the other clients could desync, that's why we sync position and physics.
 *
 * The third argument specifys the type of the variables. See
 * http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/buffers/buffer_read.html
